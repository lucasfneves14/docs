## Overview

GraphorLM's data ingestion process involves:

1. **Document upload** - Import files from various sources
2. **Text extraction** - Convert documents to machine-readable text
3. **Structure recognition** - Identify document elements and hierarchy  
4. **Metadata extraction** - Capture important document properties
5. **Content classification** - Categorize document sections

## Supported Document Types

GraphorLM supports a wide range of document formats:

| Document Type | Extensions | Features |
| ------------ | ---------- | -------- |
| Text Documents | PDF, TXT, TEXT, MD, DOC, DOCX, ODT, HTML, HTM | Full text extraction, structure preservation |
| Images | PNG, JPG, JPEG, TIFF, BMP, HEIC | OCR for text extraction, image analysis |
| Presentations | PPT, PPTX | Slide extraction, image processing |
| Spreadsheets | XLS, XLSX, CSV, TSV | Table parsing, data extraction |
| Web Content | URL | Web scraping, content extraction |

## Importing Documents

There are several ways to import documents into GraphorLM:

### Method 1: Local Files Upload

1. Navigate to **Sources** in the left sidebar
2. Click **Add Sources**
3. Select **Local files**
4. Drag and drop files or click to browse your file system
5. Click **Finish** to begin processing

  src="/images/local-files-upload.png"
  alt="Local files upload"
/>

### Method 2: URL Import

To import content directly from a web address:

1. Navigate to **Sources** in the left sidebar
2. Click **Add Sources**
3. Select **URL**
4. Enter the web address of the content you want to import
5. Click **Finish** to begin processing

GraphorLM will crawl the specified URL, extract the content, and process it for ingestion.

## Advanced OCR Processing

GraphorLM utilizes state-of-the-art OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract text from images and scanned documents.

### OCR Features

- **Multi-language support** - Recognize text in various languages
- **Layout preservation** - Maintain document structure and formatting
- **Table detection** - Extract structured data from tables
- **Image text extraction** - Identify and capture text embedded in images
- **Handwriting recognition** - Process handwritten notes (with varying accuracy)

## Document Parsing Methods and Classification

GraphorLM offers four parsing and classification methods to optimize document processing based on your needs:

### Basic

- Does not utilize OCR processing
- Classifies document elements using heuristic methods
- Suitable for simple text documents with clear structure
- Fastest processing option

### OCR Only

- Utilizes OCR for text extraction and parsing
- Classifies document elements using heuristic methods
- Recommended for scanned documents and images
- Balances processing speed and accuracy

### YOLOX

- Utilizes OCR for text extraction and parsing
- Classifies document elements using the YOLOX model
- Better recognition of document structure and components
- Improved accuracy for complex documents

### Advanced (Premium)

- Utilizes OCR for text extraction and parsing
- Classifies document elements using a fine-tuned model
- Highest accuracy for document structure recognition
- Optimized for specialized document types

To select a parsing method for your document:

1. Upload your document to GraphorLM
2. Select the document in the Sources list to open the document settings
3. In the document settings modal, locate the Methods dropdown in the top-right corner
4. Select your preferred parsing method from the dropdown menu
5. Click "Reprocess elements" to apply the new parsing method to your document
6. Wait for the reprocessing to complete - this may take a few moments depending on document size and complexity

When reprocessing is complete, you'll see the updated document structure and classification results in the preview panel.

## Content Classification

GraphorLM can automatically classify document sections to improve retrieval relevance:

### Document Element Types

The platform classifies content into the following specific element types:

- **TITLE** - Document and section titles
- **NARRATIVE_TEXT** - Main body paragraphs and content
- **LIST_ITEM** - Items in bullet points or numbered lists
- **TABLE** - Complete data tables
- **TABLE_ROW** - Individual rows within tables
- **IMAGE** - Picture or graphic elements
- **FOOTER** - Footer content at bottom of pages
- **FORMULA** - Mathematical formulas and equations
- **COMPOSITE_ELEMENT** - Elements containing multiple types
- **FIGURE_CAPTION** - Text describing images or figures
- **PAGE_BREAK** - Indicators of page separation
- **ADDRESS** - Physical address information
- **EMAIL_ADDRESS** - Email contact information
- **PAGE_NUMBER** - Page numbering elements
- **CODE_SNIPPET** - Programming code segments
- **HEADER** - Header content at top of pages
- **FORM_KEYS_VALUES** - Key-value pairs in forms
- **LINK** - Hyperlinks and references
- **UNCATEGORIZED_TEXT** - Text that doesn't fit other categories

These classifications help GraphorLM understand document structure and improve retrieval accuracy by prioritizing relevant element types when responding to queries.

## Metadata Extraction

GraphorLM automatically extracts and processes document metadata:

- File name and type
- Creation and modification dates
- Document size and page count
- Author information (when available)
- Title and description

## Monitoring Processing Status

Monitor the progress of document processing in the Sources dashboard:

- **Uploading** - Documents currently being uploaded
- **Processing** - Documents currently being converted
- **New** - Documents ready for use in RAG pipelines
- **Failed** - Documents that encountered errors during processing

For failed documents, you can view error details and retry processing with adjusted settings.

## Best Practices

To optimize data ingestion results:

1. **Use consistent formats** - When possible, standardize document formats
2. **Check processing results** - Review extracted text for accuracy
3. **Customize for complex documents** - Use advanced parsing for specialized content
4. **Monitor processing status** - Check for failed documents and resolve issues

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="file-excel" title="Poor OCR quality">
    For low-quality scanned documents, try:
    - Using OCR Only, YOLOX, or Advanced methods instead of Basic
    - Breaking large documents into smaller files
    - Improving document quality before upload if possible
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="table" title="Table extraction problems">
    If tables aren't being properly recognized:
    - Use YOLOX or Advanced method for better table detection
    - Convert complex tables to simpler formats before upload
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="language" title="Multi-language document issues">
    For documents with multiple languages:
    - Process different language sections as separate documents
    - Use YOLOX or Advanced method which has better multi-language support
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
