# Data Ingestion

Transforming unstructured documents into processable data is the foundation of any effective RAG pipeline. GraphorLM's data ingestion capabilities provide advanced tools for extracting, processing, and organizing information from various document formats.

## Overview

  alt="Data ingestion overview"
/>

GraphorLM's data ingestion process involves:

1. **Document upload** - Import files from various sources
2. **Text extraction** - Convert documents to machine-readable text
3. **Structure recognition** - Identify document elements and hierarchy  
4. **Metadata extraction** - Capture important document properties
5. **Content classification** - Categorize document sections

## Supported Document Types

GraphorLM supports a wide range of document formats:

| Document Type | Extensions | Features |
| ------------ | ---------- | -------- |
| Text Documents | PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD | Full text extraction, structure preservation |
| Images | PNG, JPG, JPEG, TIFF | OCR for text extraction, image analysis |
| Presentations | PPT, PPTX | Slide extraction, image processing |
| Spreadsheets | XLS, XLSX, CSV | Table parsing, data extraction |
| Web Content | HTML, URL | Web scraping, content extraction |
| Email | EML, MSG | Thread analysis, attachment processing |

## Importing Documents

There are several ways to import documents into GraphorLM:

### Method 1: Local Files Upload

1. Navigate to **Sources** in the left sidebar
2. Click **Add Sources**
3. Select **Local files**
4. Drag and drop files or click to browse your file system
5. Click **Finish** to begin processing

  src="/images/local-files-upload.png"
  alt="Local files upload"
/>

### Method 2: URL Import

To import content directly from a web address:

1. Navigate to **Sources** in the left sidebar
2. Click **Add Sources**
3. Select **URL**
4. Enter the web address of the content you want to import
5. Click **Finish** to begin processing

GraphorLM will crawl the specified URL, extract the content, and process it for ingestion.

## Advanced OCR Processing

GraphorLM utilizes state-of-the-art OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract text from images and scanned documents.

### OCR Features

- **Multi-language support** - Recognize text in various languages
- **Layout preservation** - Maintain document structure and formatting
- **Table detection** - Extract structured data from tables
- **Image text extraction** - Identify and capture text embedded in images
- **Handwriting recognition** - Process handwritten notes (with varying accuracy)

### Configuring OCR Settings

To customize OCR processing for a specific document:

1. Upload your document
2. Click on the document in the Sources list
3. Navigate to the **OCR Settings** tab
4. Adjust settings such as:
   - Language detection
   - Image resolution
   - Text confidence threshold
   - Layout analysis settings

## Document Parsing Methods

GraphorLM offers multiple parsing methods to optimize text extraction based on document type:

### Standard Parsing

Default parsing suitable for most document types. Extracts text while preserving basic structure.

### Smart Parsing

Enhanced parsing that better preserves document hierarchy, identifies semantic sections, and recognizes specialized content like code blocks, equations, and citations.

### Custom Parsing Rules

For complex documents with unique structures, you can define custom parsing rules:

1. Select a document in the Sources list
2. Click on **Parsing Method**
3. Select **Custom** from the dropdown
4. Define extraction rules based on:
   - Document structure
   - Content patterns
   - Section identifiers
   - Formatting cues

## Content Classification

GraphorLM can automatically classify document sections to improve retrieval relevance:

### Automatic Classification

The platform uses AI to identify and tag content types:

- Headings and titles
- Paragraphs and body text
- Lists and bullet points
- Tables and structured data
- Code blocks and technical content
- Citations and references
- Metadata and document properties

### Manual Classification

For specialized documents, you can manually classify content:

1. Select a document in the Sources list
2. Click on **Classification**
3. Navigate through the document preview
4. Select text sections and assign appropriate classifications
5. Save your changes

## Metadata Extraction

GraphorLM automatically extracts and processes document metadata:

### Standard Metadata

- File name and type
- Creation and modification dates
- Document size and page count
- Author information (when available)
- Title and description

### Custom Metadata

You can add custom metadata to enhance document organization:

1. Select a document in the Sources list
2. Click on **Metadata**
3. Click **Add Custom Field**
4. Define field name and value
5. Save changes

Custom metadata can significantly improve retrieval performance by providing additional context for search operations.

## Batch Processing

For large document collections, GraphorLM offers batch processing capabilities:

1. Navigate to **Sources** in the left sidebar
2. Click **Add Sources**
3. Select multiple files or URLs
4. Configure batch processing settings:
   - OCR parameters
   - Parsing method
   - Classification options
5. Click **Process All** to begin batch ingestion

## Monitoring Processing Status

Monitor the progress of document processing in the Sources dashboard:

- **Queued** - Documents waiting to be processed
- **Processing** - Documents currently being converted
- **Completed** - Documents ready for use in RAG pipelines
- **Failed** - Documents that encountered errors during processing

For failed documents, you can view error details and retry processing with adjusted settings.

## Best Practices

To optimize data ingestion results:

1. **Organize documents** - Group related documents for batch processing
2. **Use consistent formats** - When possible, standardize document formats
3. **Check processing results** - Review extracted text for accuracy
4. **Customize for complex documents** - Use advanced parsing for specialized content
5. **Add metadata** - Enhance documents with relevant custom metadata
6. **Monitor processing status** - Check for failed documents and resolve issues

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="file-excel" title="Poor OCR quality">
    For low-quality scanned documents, try:
    - Increasing image resolution settings
    - Adjusting contrast settings
    - Using Smart Parsing instead of Standard
    - Breaking large documents into smaller files
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="table" title="Table extraction problems">
    If tables aren't being properly recognized:
    - Enable table detection in OCR settings
    - Use Custom Parsing with table-specific rules
    - Convert complex tables to simpler formats before upload
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="language" title="Multi-language document issues">
    For documents with multiple languages:
    - Specify all languages in OCR settings
    - Process different language sections as separate documents
    - Use Smart Parsing which has better multi-language support
  </Accordion>
